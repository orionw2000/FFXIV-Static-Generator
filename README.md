# FFXIV-Static-Generator
Given an input of players' jobs and availabilities, generates a compatable group of 8 players (based on the game FFXIV).
Currently just a WIP with the logic implemented, no user interface or anything. Potential plans include adding a database 
and have requests to add/remove/update players, and whenever I choose I can run the generator. Eventually I may add user 
friendliness.

Made just because I was bored and had no ideas.
